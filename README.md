    - I opened Git Bash and configured Git with my username and email
    - I initialized a Git repository for my project:
      ```bash
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m
      ```
  - Outcome: Git installed and configured successfully.

- **Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:**

    - I went to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
    - I downloaded the latest version of Python.
    - I located the downloaded file and double-clicked to install.
    - After installation, I opened Command Prompt (cmd) and typed:
      ```bash
      python --version
      ```
    - I encountered an issue: Command Prompt showed a message indicating to either install Python from Microsoft Store or disable the restriction.
    - Solution: I installed Python directly from the Microsoft Store.
    - I verified the installation again in Command Prompt:
      ```bash
      python --version
      ```
  - Outcome: Python installed successfully.

- **Install Package Managers:**

  - I ensured pip (Python package manager) was installed.
  - Steps:
    - After installing Python, pip was installed automatically.
    - I verified pip installation in Command Prompt:
      ```bash

    - I also installed other useful extensions, such as:
      - **Python**
      - **GitLens**
      - **ESLint**
  - Outcome: Extensions installed to improve coding workflow.

### Reflection:

- **Challenges:**

  - I encountered an issue with Python installation due to restrictions in Command Prompt.
  - I faced an installation issue with MySQL due to a missing Visual C++ Redistributable.

- **Solutions:**
  - I resolved the Python installation issue by installing it from the Microsoft Store.
  - I fixed the MySQL installation by downloading and installing the required Visual C++ Redistributable package from the Microsoft site.
